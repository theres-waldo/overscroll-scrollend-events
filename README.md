# overscroll-scrollend-events
This repository contains a [proposed specification](https://wicg.github.io/overscroll-scrollend-events/) for a new scroll events called overscroll and scrollend for the documents that are being scrolled to complete the existing scroll event and expose more information to the content that is being scrolled.

If incubation around this API is successful (e.g. is shipped by multiple browsers) then this spec hopefully will transition to [the W3C CSS specification](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3801).
